Jan 29, 2020 at 12:49, Due to the U.S. sanctions on Iran, Tehran is unable to use or transfer US$5 billion in revenues it has received from Iraq for supplying natural gas and electricity to its neighbor, an Iranian official told local media on Wednesday.

Even after the U.S. slapped sanctions on Iran’s energy exports, Iraq continues to import natural gas and electricity from Iran under a special waiver that the United States has regularly extended to Iraq.

Major Iraqi power plants are dependent on Iranian natural gas supply, and Iraq also imports electricity from Iran, as Baghdad’s power generation is not enough to ensure domestic supply.

Despite the U.S. waiver for energy trade between Iran and Iraq, Iran is unable to use the money Iraq has paid in Iraqi dinars for the energy it imports from Iran.

Up to $5 billion sits in an escrow account at the central bank of Iraq, but Iran cannot touch it because of the U.S. sanctions, Hamid Hosseini, a spokesman for Iranian Oil, Gas and Petrochemical Products Exporters’ Association (OPEX) told Iranian news outlet Press-TV on Wednesday. Iran has been cut off from the global SWIFT payment system, and because of this, it hasn’t found a way yet to have the money transferred, according to Press-TV.

The situation highlights how the U.S. sanctions are crippling Iranian revenues and how Iran cannot access money from its energy exports even if those exports are allowed under the U.S. sanctions.

Iraq, for its part, may have serious problems in securing its energy needs if the United States doesn’t extend a waiver for an Iraqi bank to process payments for Iraq’s imports of electricity and natural gas from Iran, the head of the Iraqi bank told AFP last week.

The waiver for the Iraqi bank handling the payments to Iran in Iraqi dinars expires next month. If the U.S. doesn’t extend the waiver, the bank—Trade Bank of Iraq (TBI)—will stop processing payments, the head of the bank Faisal al-Haimus told AFP last week.

Jan 29, 2020 at 11:06, It isn’t often that Detroit gets a multi-million-dollar reprieve, but this is the auto revolution 2.0, and there is some hope yet for the Motor City, with General Motors unveiling plans to spend $2.2 billion to produce autonomous and electric vehicles at its Detroit Hamtramck plant, recently on the brink of closing down entirely.

The announcement came just a week after GM’s Cruise subsidiary unveiled Origin, its first self-driving car without a steering wheel or pedals.

In addition to the Origin, the facility will also produce all-electric SUVs and pickup trucks.

GM plans to release 20 electric vehicles by 2023, the first of which will be an electric truck slated to go into production in 2021. The production is expected to include a Hummer pickup under the GMC brand.

The fact is that GM is lagging behind its competitors, particularly in the luxury EV market. The company hasn’t released a new electric vehicle since the Chevy Bolt nearly four years ago. Yet, over the last year, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar, and BMW have all introduced high-end electric vehicles.

With that in mind, GM plans to turn Cadillac into its leading EV brand to go all electric by 2030 in hopes that this will enable it to catch up with the others.

Detroit-Hamtramck currently employs about 900 people and was slated for shutdown last summer until the company changed course after discussions with the union. The factory will still be shut down at the end of next month, when renovations are set to start. The plant will have 2,000 employees once it is at full capacity.

In December, also in line with plans to play catchup, GM announced a joint venture with LG Chem to mass-produce batteries for electric cars. Two companies are planning to invest a total of $2.3 billion to build a new facility in Lordstown, Ohio. The factory will supply cells to vehicles made at the Detroit plant.

GM noted that the recent support received from the state of Michigan was a key factor for the new $2.2-billion investment decision.

The announcement came just a few days after the Michigan Strategic Fund agreed to revise tax breaks for GM in exchange for the company’s commitment to invest at least $3.5 billion more over 10 years in the state.

“This investment helps ensure that Michigan will remain at the epicenter of the global automotive industry as we continue our journey to an electrified future,” GM president Mark Reuss said in a statement.

Earlier this month, GM reported that its customer deliveries for the fourth quarter of 2019 declined 6.3 percent from year, due to the 40-day United Auto Workers (UAW) work stoppage.

Back in 2018, GM announced plans to cut up to 14,000 jobs, close five factories by the end of last year and shift the company’s workforce and lineup to build more electric and autonomous vehicles. The strike was negotiating a new labor contract that could save some of those factories from closing down and preserving the jobs in the state.

The UAW expects the move away from gas engines could cut 35,000 jobs over the next several years, according to a research study conducted by the union last year.

As a result of GM and UAW deal, some factories and jobs will be saved, but there is still room for GM to layoff quite a few workers.

The Michigan Strategic Fund agreement requires GM to maintain 34,750 employees in Michigan in order to receive 100% credit for the remaining credit term. GM currently has 48,000 employees in the state.

Jan 29, 2020 at 10:48, According to new research by the National Grid, in total the UK will need to fill 400,000 jobs by 2050 to ensure it makes the transition successfully.

The total number combines both jobs which will need to be created, which number 260,000, whilst 140,000 will be to replace those who have left the workforce.

Over 100,000 of the jobs will become available in the north of England, whilst 48,000 new roles will need filling in Scotland, which for its part, is on track to becoming a world renewables leader by 2030.

In the next decade, 65,000 roles will be available for data analysts to forecast energy demand and engineers with expertise in renewables.

The remaining 52,000 will be needed to replace workers set to leave the sector, as 20 per cent of the current energy sector workforce is set to retire by 2030.

Nicola Shaw CBE, executive director of National Grid, said: “Britain reached a major milestone last year as we saw zero carbon electricity outstrip fossil fuels for the first time. But there’s still a long way to go. As the pathway to net zero becomes clearer, so must our understanding of the jobs and skills we need to succeed.

“Our research shows that to deliver net zero, the energy industry needs to recruit hundreds of thousands of people over the next thirty years – and that really is the tip of the iceberg in terms of the wider impact of net zero across other industries.”

Business minister Kwasi Kwarteng, said: “Tackling climate change is not only saving the planet, but is significantly boosting our economy.

“As we work to reduce our emissions to net zero by 2050, the UK has the potential to support two million green-collar jobs across our world-class renewables sector, among other industries.”

According to industry body Energy UK, around 144,000 people are currently directly employed by the sector.

Making the transition to net zero by 2050 will involve a wholesale recalibration of the UK’s energy infrastructure, from increased electricity generation to low carbon heating systems and installing some 60,000 EV charging points.

National Grid, which partnered with Development Economics on the paper, said that in order to fill the roles available the sector will have to tackle challenges such as the loss of talent due to retirement and a limited pipeline of young people with STEM qualifications.

Despite the lofty challenges ahead, the UK is already making significant progress in its clean energy ambitions, with renewable electricity generation outpacing fossil fuels for the first time ever.

Jan 29, 2020 at 10:45, The Iran-affiliated Houthi movement in Yemen claimed on Wednesday that it targeted Saudi Aramco facilities in Jizan, a city just north of Yemen on the Red Sea, but Saudi Arabia has not yet confirmed or denied the report.

The alleged Houthi attack came as retaliation for “escalating air strikes,” on Yemen by the Saudi coalition, and if confirmed, this would be the first attack from Yemen’s Houthis on targets in Saudi Arabia since the end of September, Reuters notes.

Back in September, just after the attacks on Saudi Aramco’s oil facilities Abqaiq and Khurais, the Houthis pledged to halt attacks with drones and ballistic missiles against Saudi Arabian targets if Saudi Arabia stopped air strikes on Yemen.

Saudi Arabia and Iran are essentially fighting a proxy war in Yemen, where the Saudis lead a military Arab coalition to “restore legitimacy” in the country, while the Houthi movement, which holds the capital Sanaa, is backed by Iran.

Yahya Saria, a military spokesman for the Houthi movement, said on Wednesday, as carried by Reuters, that apart from facilities owned by Saudi Aramco, the Houthis also targeted the airports of Abha and Jizan.

The Houthis have claimed responsibility for the September 14 attacks on Saudi Aramco’s oil facilities that cut off 5 percent of daily global supply for weeks. But Saudi Arabia and the United States have said that it was Iran—and not the Houthis—who was responsible for the attack.

The Houthi rebels in Yemen were not the ones who launched the drone and missile attack on Saudi oil infrastructure last September, a confidential report from the UN revealed earlier this month.

“That despite their claims to the contrary, the Houthi forces did not launch the attacks on Abqaiq and Khurais on 14 September 2019,” Reuters quoted the report’s authors from the UN Security Council Yemen sanctions committee as saying.

Jan 29, 2020 at 09:07, The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is preparing to release new oil speculation rules that would limit the number of positions hedge funds and other speculators can open on oil and other commodities, Bloomberg has reported, citing unnamed sources in the know.

However, the new rules could end up benefiting traders, according to the Bloomberg sources, as they would include higher maximum thresholds for commodity bets for some commodity contracts that are physically settled. The reason, the source said, was that the CFTC has based the new rules on data about deliverable supplies of various commodities, and that data suggests that the amount of these deliverable supplies is higher than earlier estimations suggested.

The need for tougher regulation on commodity speculation was one of the consequences of the 2008 financial crisis. Over the last ten years, however, the CFTC has met with strong opposition from powerful stakeholders in the commodity sphere, including the energy industry, among others. Now, however, this opposition could quieten as the rules would favor large speculators, according to the Bloomberg sources.

Currently, the CFTC has position limits on nine agricultural commodity contracts. Bourses, for their part, impose their own limits on energy and precious metals futures. With the new rules, the Bloomberg source said, the CFTC position limits are likely to be higher than those imposed by exchanges and exchanges might end up having to relax their limits in response to the official ones.

All in all, according to the sources, it would be better for stakeholders in the commodity trading area if the new rules are approved now rather than after the elections in November when the CFTC could see a change of management. Democrats, the logic goes, would be a lot stricter than Republicans in setting futures speculation limits, so it is in the interest of those opposing any changes so far to play along with the CFTC.

The commission is voting on the new rules on Thursday.

Jan 29, 2020 at 09:03, Oil prices rose slightly on Tuesday, changing course after a brutal few days in the wake of the deadly Coronavirus that has threatened the markets the world over.

Oil prices slid for five straight days, with WTI falling $5 per barrel from $58.58 a week ago Monday, to $53.14 yesterday. But the US benchmark price inched up slightly on Tuesday, to $53.40, suggesting that the worst of the market selloff courtesy of the Coronavirus could possibly be behind us.

Brent prices fell nearly $7 per barrel, from $65.20 a week ago Monday, to $58.58 yesterday.

While oil prices appear to have stopped falling, the virus is still on a tear, reaching more than 10 countries with over 100 lives lost, nearly 5,000 infected, and travel severely restricted in and out of certain regions in China—a fact which has sparked fear that oil demand could be dented as a result of the subdued economic activity and plethora of canceled flights.

And on Tuesday, the CDC announced that in conjunction with the US State Department, that travelers avoid “unnecessary travel to China.”

Oil demand concerns were already at the forefront of the oil market for most of last year, and this new hitch has been more than major outages in Libya could offset. Until now, demand for jet fuel in China has remained healthy.

Some oil stocks had also stopped this week’s brutal slide on Tuesday, with ConocoPhillips, Phillips 66, EOG Resources, Exxon, Total, Chevron, and Occidental all clawing back some of their previous losses.

BP, Shell, and Hess, however, were still trading down on the day as of Tuesday afternoon.

In a press conference on Tuesday, the CDC’s Health Secretary Alex Azar warned Americans that “This is a very fast moving, constantly changing situation,” adding that “part of the risk we face right now is that we don’t know everything we need to know about this virus.”

Jan 28, 2020 at 15:49, The American Petroleum Institute (API) estimated on Tuesday a surprise large crude oil inventory draw of 4.27 million barrels for the week ending January 24, compared to analyst expectations of a 482,000-barrel build in inventory.

Last week saw a build in crude oil inventories of 1.57 million barrels, according to API data. The EIA’s estimates, however, were of a draw of 400,000 barrels for that week.

Oil prices were up earlier in the day prior to the afternoon data release, ending a five day price slide as fears of oil demand destruction at the hands of the deadly Coronavirus gripped the oil markets. Even with Libya’s near-complete production shutdown of nearly 1 million barrels per day, oil prices were still down week over week.

At 3:43 pm EST on Tuesday the WTI benchmark was trading up $0.46 (+0.87%) at $53.60—roughly down $5 per barrel under last week’s levels. The price of a Brent barrel was also trading up slightly on Tuesday, by $0.33 (+0.56%), at $58.91—off more than $6 per barrel compared to last week’s prices.

The API this week also reported a build of 3.27 million barrels of gasoline for week ending January 24, after last week’s large 4.5-million-barrel build. This week’s large gasoline build compares to analyst expectations of a 1.32-million barrel-build for the week.

Distillate inventories were down by 141,000 barrels for the week, compared to last week’s large 3.5-million-barrel build, while Cushing inventories rose by 1.02 million barrels.

US crude oil production as estimated by the Energy Information Administration showed that production for the week ending January 17 held fast at 13.0 million bpd, a record high for the United States.

At 4:43 pm EDT, WTI was trading at $53.57, while Brent was trading at $58.88.

Jan 28, 2020 at 14:00, ExxonMobil and Egypt have signed two oil and gas exploration deals in the Eastern Mediterranean, the Egyptian Ministry of Petroleum said on Tuesday, weeks after Exxon said it had secured exploration acreage offshore Egypt.

The two exploration deals call for a total investment of at least US$332 million, according to a statement from Egypt’s petroleum ministry, carried by Reuters.

At the end of 2019, ExxonMobil said that it had acquired more than 1.7 million acres offshore Egypt, adding upstream interests to its downstream business in the country.

Exxon bought the 1.2-million-acre North Marakia Offshore block, five miles offshore Egypt’s northern coast and 543,000 acres in the North East El Amriya Offshore block in the Nile Delta. ExxonMobil, which will be the operator of both blocks with 100-percent interest, plans to start exploration operations this year.

“These awards strengthen our exploration portfolio in the Eastern Mediterranean,” Mike Cousins, senior vice president of exploration and new ventures at ExxonMobil, said in a statement at the end of December.

Last year, Exxon made a natural gas discovery at the Glaucus-1 well in a block offshore Cyprus.

Offshore Egypt, the discovery of the giant Zohr gas field in 2015 has sparked interest in more exploration in the Mediterranean.

Exxon’s foray into Egypt’s upstream comes at a time of heightened tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean, where Turkey, Greece, and Cyprus are at odds over Turkey’s claim to natural gas resources recently discovered offshore Cyprus.

Turkey will continue exploring for oil and gas in the eastern Mediterranean waters around disputed Cyprus, and “No project can be realised if Turkey and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus are not involved,” Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdo?an said in August last year.

Since then, Ankara has been moving forward with its drilling plans despite criticism from not just Cyprus but also Greece and the European Union. Earlier this month, the EU warned Turkey to reconsider its drilling plans after Erdogan said drilling would start “as soon as possible.” The EU also called these exploration plans illegal.

Jan 28, 2020 at 13:44, U.S. oil producer Hess Corporation said on Tuesday it expects to allocate US$3 billion for production, development, and exploration in 2020, focusing on high-return investments in the Bakken shale play and offshore Guyana.

Hess Corporation is boosting this year’s capital and exploratory budget from the 2019 E&P capital and exploratory expenditures of US$2.7 billion, as expected at the end of Q3 2019.

More than 80 percent of Hess’s capital and exploratory budget for 2020 will go for increased production and development of the corporation’s production in the Bakken in North Dakota and offshore Guyana, where Hess is a minority partner of ExxonMobil in the first development of the Latin American country’s oil resources.

Hess expects its net production to average between 330,000 and 335,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) this year, excluding Libya operations. Net production in the Bakken is seen averaging 180,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2020.

“In the Bakken, we plan to maintain a six rig program through the year, which is expected to result in our net production growing to approximately 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by the end of 2020,” chief operating officer Greg Hill said in a statement.

Offshore Guyana, Hess will focus on the Liza Phase 2 development, the front end engineering design (FEED) work to develop the nearby Payara oilfield, and on exploration. Hess plans to explore for resources in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, too, Hill noted.

Just yesterday, Exxon and Hess said they had revised upward the estimate of recoverable resources offshore Guyana by 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent to 8 billion oil-equivalent barrels, also announcing the 16th oil discovery on the Stabroek Block.

“We also continue to see multibillion barrels of additional exploration potential remaining,” said John Hess, chief executive of Hess, which holds 30 percent in the Stabroek Block, where Exxon is the operator.

Jan 28, 2020 at 13:02, As part of a new development strategy, Lukoil plans to invest more than US$100 billion in various projects, primarily in Russia, Vagit Alekperov, the chief executive of Russia’s second-largest oil producer, told President Vladimir Putin during a meeting on Tuesday.

Lukoil is preparing a new strategy and will start actively working in the Baltic shelf, Alekperov told Putin in a meeting to discuss the company’s 2019 performance and plans for the future.

Outside Russia, the privately owned Russian oil producer sees development and investment opportunities in West Africa, which is one of the most promising markets, Alekperov said.

Lukoil is already present in three countries in West Africa, while another four countries in the region offer the Russian company joint development work, the manager told Putin.

Russian oil companies are encouraged to work in West Africa after a Russia-Africa summit which Putin hosted in October.

Lukoil is looking at joint oil and gas opportunities with Saudi Aramco in Africa, Alekperov said at the Russia-Africa forum in October. Lukoil and the Saudi oil giant are in good relations and constantly exploring joint opportunities in third countries, including in Africa, the Russian manager said.

Now Russian companies, including Lukoil, are looking for deals in West Africa.

In Russia, Lukoil expects that total Russian crude oil and condensate production could rise to more than 12 million bpd by 2035, if global demand for liquid hydrocarbons continues to grow, the company said in a new forecast last month. Currently, Russia pumps around 11.2 million bpd of oil and condensate.

Referring to the U.S. sanctions on Russia’s oil industry, Lukoil said that although these restrictions are unlikely to impact domestic production in the near term, they will have a significant impact in the long term.

Commenting on the OPEC+ deal, which Russian firms have criticized, Lukoil said in December after the OPEC+ meeting that “We expect that Russia will remain a party to the OPEC+ Agreement for a long time, coordinating its activities with other oil-producing nations.”
